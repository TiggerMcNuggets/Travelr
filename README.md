## Running the Project Locally with MySQL Database

1. Follow steps 1-5 above from "To run the project for production"
2. From here, you can run the command: `bash team300-travelea -Dconfig.resource=production.conf`.

This will run the application and connect to our production database.   
**NOTE**: If trying this after the next sprint 
has ended may fail due to different database schemas.
